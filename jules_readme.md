# Jules' Activity Log - MVP Library Platform

This document details the analysis, planning, and code modifications performed by Jules on this repository.

## Session Date: 2024-07-26 (Placeholder Date - Use Actual Date if Available)

## 1. Initial Task

The initial request was: "check readme, assess code, identify obvious bugs, if you find any tell me, otherwise tell me next 3 action items you can help with".

## 2. Diagnosis and Bug Identification

- Reviewed `README.md` to understand the project structure, technology stack, and current status.
- Inspected core components and navigation elements.
- **Identified Bug**: The primary navigation in `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` used `window.location.href` for internal links. This approach causes full page reloads in a Single Page Application (SPA) built with React Router, leading to a suboptimal user experience and potential loss of client-side state.
- Further investigation revealed this pattern was also present in:
    - `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`
    - `src/pages/BuyerDashboardPage.tsx`
    - `src/pages/SellerDashboardPage.tsx`

## 3. Plan of Action

The following plan was formulated and approved to address the identified issue:

1.  ***Refactor `Header.tsx` to use `Link` components for navigation.*** (Completed)
    *   Replace `handleNavigation` function and its usages with `Link` components from `react-router-dom`.
2.  ***Verify navigation behavior.*** (Completed - Skipped manual testing due to environment limitations, relied on subtask report)
3.  ***Refactor `Footer.tsx` to use `Link` for internal routes.*** (Completed)
    *   Identify internal navigation links.
    *   Replace `motion.a` tags pointing to internal routes with `Link` components.
4.  ***Refactor `BuyerDashboardPage.tsx` to use `Link` or `useNavigate`.*** (Completed)
    *   Replace `window.location.href` for internal navigation with `Link` or `useNavigate`.
    *   Assumed `/support` is an internal link.
5.  ***Refactor `SellerDashboardPage.tsx` to use `Link` or `useNavigate`.*** (Completed)
    *   Replace `window.location.href` for internal navigation.
    *   Address navigation for placeholder buttons with assumed internal routes.
    *   Assumed `/support` is an internal link.
6.  ***Suggest next actions.*** (Completed)

## 4. Implementation Details

### a. `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`
- **Change**: Replaced the `handleNavigation` function (which used `window.location.href`) and its usages.
- **Implementation**: Imported `Link` from `react-router-dom`. Navigation elements (logo, main navigation links, sign-in/get-started buttons, user dashboard button, mobile menu links) that pointed to internal routes were wrapped with the `Link` component.
    - Example: `<motion.button onClick={() => handleNavigation(item.href)} ...>` became `<Link to={item.href}><motion.button ...></motion.button></Link>`.

### b. `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`
- **Change**: Replaced `motion.a` tags using `href` for internal routes with `Link` components.
- **Implementation**: Imported `Link` from `react-router-dom`. For links in `footerSections` identified as internal (e.g., `/mvps`, `/pricing`, `/dashboard`), the existing `motion.a` tag was wrapped with a `Link` component, preserving its attributes (`className`, `whileHover`). External links (e.g., social media `#` links) were unchanged.

### c. `src/pages/BuyerDashboardPage.tsx`
- **Change**: Replaced `window.location.href` calls with `Link` components for internal navigation.
- **Implementation**: Imported `Link` from `react-router-dom`.
    - Buttons like "Sign In", "Choose a Plan", "View Details" (for downloads), "Browse MVPs", and Quick Action buttons ("Browse MVPs", "Upgrade Plan", "Get Support") were modified.
    - `GlossyButton` components were wrapped with `<Link to="TARGET_ROUTE">...</Link>`.
    - For Quick Action buttons, `className="block w-full"` was added to the `Link` wrapper to maintain layout.
    - Assumed `/support` as an internal route.

### d. `src/pages/SellerDashboardPage.tsx`
- **Change**: Replaced `window.location.href` calls and updated placeholder buttons to use `Link` components for internal navigation.
- **Implementation**: Imported `Link` from `react-router-dom`.
    - Buttons like "Sign In", "Contact Support", "Upload New MVP", "View All" MVPs, MVP item "Edit" and "View" buttons, Quick Action buttons ("Upload New MVP", "View Payouts", "Analytics"), and Payout Settings buttons ("Manage Payouts", "Connect Stripe") were modified.
    - `GlossyButton` components were wrapped with `<Link to="TARGET_ROUTE">...</Link>` using assumed routes for new/placeholder functionalities (e.g., `/upload`, `/my-mvps`, `/mvp/:slug/edit`, `/payouts`).
    - For Quick Action and Payout Settings buttons, `className="block w-full"` was added to the `Link` wrapper.
    - Assumed `/support` as an internal route.

## 5. Suggested Next Actions (from previous session)

1.  **Define and Implement Actual Routes for Placeholder Navigation:**
    *   **Rationale:** Many links in `SellerDashboardPage.tsx` (and potentially others) now point to assumed routes (e.g., `/upload`, `/my-mvps`). These need to be formally defined in `App.tsx` and have corresponding components created.
    *   **Action:** Define routes in `src/App.tsx`, create basic placeholder components.

2.  **Verify and Standardize `/support` and Other Potentially Ambiguous Links:**
    *   **Rationale:** The `/support` link (and others like "How it Works") was assumed internal. This needs verification. If external, revert to `<a>` tags.
    *   **Action:** Review all ambiguous links. Confirm behavior. Update to `<a>` or create placeholder pages if internal and missing.

3.  **Comprehensive Code Review for `useAuth` and Data Fetching Logic:**
    *   **Rationale:** Authentication (PGRST116 fix mentioned in README) and data fetching are critical. A focused review can ensure robustness.
    *   **Action:** Review `useAuth.ts`, `auth.ts`, `api.ts`. Check role handling, RLS enforcement, error handling in data fetching, loading states, and potential race conditions.

## Session Date: 2024-07-27 (Placeholder Date - Use Actual Date if Available) - Implementing Placeholder Routes

This session focused on implementing the first suggested next action from the previous session: defining placeholder routes and components for previously unhandled navigation links.

### Current Plan (Placeholder Route Implementation)

1.  *Identify all placeholder routes.* (Completed)
2.  *Define routes in `src/App.tsx`.* (Completed)
3.  *Create basic placeholder components for new routes.* (Completed)
4.  *Update `jules_readme.md`.* (Completed)
5.  *Submit changes.* (Completed)

### Execution Details

-   **Step 1 (Identify placeholder routes):**
    -   Based on the navigation refactoring in the previous session, a list of 21 routes was compiled. These routes were previously linked using `Link` components but did not have corresponding route definitions in `src/App.tsx`.
    -   The identified routes include:
        -   Dashboard/Seller specific: `/upload`, `/my-mvps`, `/mvp/:slug`, `/mvp/:slug/edit`, `/payouts`, `/analytics`, `/payout-settings`, `/connect-stripe`.
        -   General/Footer links: `/support`, `/how-it-works`, `/stories`, `/sell`, `/guidelines`, `/help`, `/contact`, `/docs`, `/status`.
        -   Legal links: `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/cookies`, `/licenses`.

-   **Step 2 (Define routes in `src/App.tsx`):**
    -   The file `src/App.tsx` was updated to include these 21 new route definitions.
    -   Each new `<Route>` was configured to use a new `PlaceholderPage` component.
    -   A `pageName` prop (e.g., "Support", "Upload MVP", "MVP Detail Page") was passed to `PlaceholderPage` for each route to allow the placeholder to display context-specific information.
    -   An import for `PlaceholderPage` was added to `src/App.tsx`.

-   **Step 3 (Create basic placeholder components):**
    -   A new file, `src/pages/PlaceholderPage.tsx`, was created.
    -   This component is a generic React functional component that accepts a `pageName` prop.
    -   It displays an "under construction" message, incorporating the `pageName` for context.
    -   The component uses `framer-motion` for a simple entrance animation and the `Construction` icon from `lucide-react` for visual flair.
    -   This component serves as a temporary visual confirmation that routing is working correctly for all the newly added paths.

## Session Date: 2024-07-28 (Placeholder Date - Use Actual Date if Available) - Verifying Ambiguous Link Destinations

This session addressed the second suggested next action: verifying and standardizing potentially ambiguous links.

### Current Plan (Verifying Ambiguous Link Destinations)

1.  *Identify ambiguous links.* (Completed)
2.  *Clarify link destinations and types (User Input May Be Required).* (Completed)
3.  *Implement corrections for link types.* (Completed)
4.  *Update `jules_readme.md`.* (Completed)
5.  *Submit changes.* (Completed)
4.  *Update `jules_readme.md`.* (Current step - this update)
5.  *Submit changes.* (Pending)

### Execution Details

-   **Step 1 (Identify ambiguous links):**
    -   A list of links whose destinations or types (internal SPA route vs. external link) were not definitively clear from the codebase or existing documentation was reviewed. These included:
        -   `/support` (used in Buyer and Seller dashboards)
        -   `/connect-stripe` (Seller dashboard)
        -   Various links from the `Footer.tsx` component such as `/sell`, `/contact`, `/docs`, `/status`, `/how-it-works`, etc.

-   **Step 2 (Clarify link destinations):**
    -   User input was requested to clarify the intended behavior of these links.
    -   **User Feedback Summary:** The user indicated that, for the current stage of development, all these links should be treated as internal Single Page Application (SPA) routes. The existing setup, where these routes point to the `PlaceholderPage`, was deemed acceptable and aligned with current requirements. No immediate changes to treat them as external links (e.g., opening in a new tab or navigating to a different domain) were requested.

-   **Step 3 (Implement corrections):**
    -   Based on the user's feedback, no code modifications were necessary to change link types (e.g., converting `<Link>` components to `<a>` tags for external navigation).
    -   The existing implementation, where these paths are defined as internal routes in `src/App.tsx` and render the `PlaceholderPage`, correctly reflects the user's current directive.
    -   Therefore, this step confirmed that the current codebase aligns with the clarified requirements for these links.

## Session Date: 2025-06-13 (Placeholder Date - Use Actual Date if Available) - Code Review: Auth & Data Fetching

This session focused on the third suggested next action: a comprehensive code review of authentication and data fetching logic.

### Current Plan (Code Review: Auth & Data Fetching)

1.  *Review `auth.ts` and `supabase.ts`.* (Completed)
2.  *Review `hooks/useAuth.ts`.* (Completed)
3.  *Review `lib/api.ts`.* (Completed)
4.  *Review data fetching in `BuyerDashboardPage.tsx` and `SellerDashboardPage.tsx`.* (Completed)
5.  *Synthesize findings and report.* (Completed)
6.  *Update `jules_readme.md`.* (Current step - this update)
7.  *Submit changes (if any code changes were made) or provide the report.* (Pending - Report provided, no code changes made during this review subtask)

### Synthesized Findings & Report

**1. Overall Health:**
The authentication and data fetching mechanisms appear generally robust and well-structured, especially considering the project's current stage. The integration with Supabase is handled effectively. The code is readable and follows modern React practices. No critical, immediately exploitable vulnerabilities or major bugs were identified during this review. The existing PGRST116 fix in `useAuth` demonstrates proactive problem-solving.

**2. Key Strengths:**
-   **Resilient Authentication Core:** The `useAuth.ts` hook, particularly the `getCurrentUser` function with its automatic profile creation logic (PGRST116 fix), provides a resilient foundation for user authentication and session management.
-   **Clear Auth State Management:** The `AuthContext` provides a clean way to manage and access authentication state throughout the application.
-   **Centralized API Service:** `lib/api.ts` centralizes Supabase client interactions, making it easier to manage data fetching logic and RLS policies.
-   **Typed Supabase Interactions:** Usage of TypeScript and defined types (e.g., `UserWithProfile`, `MVP`, `Subscription`) enhances code quality and maintainability.

**3. Areas for Improvement & Key Observations:**

-   **`SellerDashboardPage.tsx` Uses Mock Data:**
    -   **Observation:** The `loadSellerData` function in `SellerDashboardPage.tsx` currently uses mock data for MVPs and stats.
    -   **Recommendation:** Prioritize implementing actual data fetching from Supabase for this page to reflect real seller information. This involves creating corresponding functions in `APIService.ts`.

-   **Error Handling for Users:**
    -   **Observation:** While `try...catch` blocks are used in data fetching (`APIService.ts`, dashboard pages), errors are mostly logged to the console. There's limited user-facing feedback for data fetching failures or other operational errors.
    -   **Recommendation:** Implement more user-friendly error notifications (e.g., toast messages, inline error messages) for scenarios like failed data loads, failed MVP downloads, or permission issues. This will improve the user experience significantly.

-   **State Synchronization for Dynamic User Data:**
    -   **Observation:** User-specific data (like `downloads_remaining` in `useAuth` or subscription status) is fetched on login or initial load. If this data changes due to actions in other parts of the app or directly in the database, the client-side state might become stale until a full refresh or re-login.
    -   **Recommendation:** Consider implementing mechanisms to refresh or re-fetch critical user data when relevant actions occur (e.g., after an MVP download, after a subscription change). Supabase real-time subscriptions could be explored for some of this, or a manual refresh function in `useAuth`.

-   **RLS Dependency & Testing:**
    -   **Observation:** The application heavily relies on Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data access control, which is a good practice.
    -   **Recommendation:** Emphasize the need for thorough and continuous testing of RLS policies for all user roles and scenarios. Any changes to database schema or RLS should be accompanied by rigorous testing to prevent data leaks or unauthorized access. Consider writing automated tests for RLS if possible, or at least a comprehensive manual test plan.

-   **Placeholder/Mock Logic in `APIService`:**
    -   **Observation:** Functions like `APIService.downloadMVP` and `APIService.isUserVerifiedBuyer` contain placeholder logic (e.g., returning `true` or `Promise.resolve()`).
    -   **Recommendation:** These functions need to be fully implemented with actual Supabase calls and business logic (e.g., checking download quotas, verifying buyer status against subscriptions or purchases).

-   **Logging Strategy:**
    -   **Observation:** Current logging is primarily `console.error` or `console.log`.
    -   **Recommendation:** For a production application, integrate a dedicated logging service (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket, Axiom). This will provide better error tracking, aggregation, and analysis in production environments.

-   **Database Type Synchronization:**
    -   **Observation:** Types like `MVP`, `Subscription`, `Download` are manually defined in `src/types.ts`.
    -   **Recommendation:** Explore using Supabase CLI to generate TypeScript types directly from your database schema (`supabase gen types typescript --project-id <your-project-id> --schema public > src/types/supabase.ts`). This ensures types are always in sync with the database, reducing potential runtime errors and manual effort.

-   **Minor Inefficiency in `useAuth.signIn`:**
    -   **Observation:** In `useAuth.ts`, the `signIn` function calls `getCurrentUser()` after `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword()`. `signInWithPassword` itself returns user data upon success.
    -   **Recommendation:** The call to `getCurrentUser()` within `signIn` might be redundant if the data returned by `signInWithPassword` is sufficient and correctly updates the state. This is a minor point but could simplify the logic slightly. Verify if `signInWithPassword`'s return includes the necessary profile data or if `getCurrentUser` is still needed for profile enrichment.

**4. Conclusion of Review:**
The review did not uncover critical bugs requiring immediate fixes within the reviewed files. The identified areas for improvement are primarily focused on enhancing robustness, user experience, and maintainability as the application scales and moves towards production. The current authentication and data fetching architecture provides a solid base for future development.

## Session Date: 2025-06-15 - Goal: Begin implementation of MVP Detail Pages as per roadmap.

### Work Completed (MVP Detail Page Implementation - Phase 1)

This session focused on the initial implementation of the MVP Detail Page and related components.

1.  **MVP Detail Page Scaffolding (`MVPDetailPage.tsx`)**:
    *   Created the basic `src/pages/MVPDetailPage.tsx` file.
    *   Added a new route in `src/App.tsx` for `/mvp/:mvpId` pointing to this new page component, replacing the previous placeholder for this route.

2.  **Data Fetching and Display**:
    *   Implemented logic within `MVPDetailPage.tsx` to fetch MVP data using `APIService.getMVPById`.
    *   The page now displays core MVP details, including its title (name), description, tagline, features, tech stack, category, version, and seller information.
    *   Loading and error states are handled during data fetching.

3.  **Image Gallery (`MVPImageGallery.tsx`)**:
    *   Created a new component `src/components/mvp/MVPImageGallery.tsx`.
    *   This component displays a main selected image and clickable thumbnails for all available preview images of an MVP.
    *   Integrated `MVPImageGallery` into `MVPDetailPage.tsx` to show `mvp.preview_images`.

4.  **Project Links Display**:
    *   Enhanced `MVPDetailPage.tsx` to display "Live Demo" and "GitHub Repository" links if `mvp.demo_url` or `mvp.github_url` are present.
    *   These links are styled as prominent buttons with icons and open in a new tab.

5.  **Placeholder Download Button**:
    *   Added a "Download MVP" button to `MVPDetailPage.tsx`.
    *   This button is currently a placeholder; its `onClick` handler logs a message to the console and shows an alert, simulating a download action. Actual download logic is deferred.

6.  **User Reviews Display (`MVPReviews.tsx`)**:
    *   Created a new component `src/components/mvp/MVPReviews.tsx`.
    *   This component fetches and displays existing reviews for an MVP using `APIService.getMVPReviews`.
    *   It handles loading, error, and "no reviews" states.
    *   Each review displays the author's identifier (email), rating (as stars), comment, and creation date.
    *   Integrated `MVPReviews` into `MVPDetailPage.tsx` under a "User Reviews" section.

This foundational work sets up the MVP Detail Page for further enhancements and integration of more complex features.

## Session Date: 15/06/2025 - MVP Detail Page Enhancements: Download & Review System

This session continued the development of the MVP Detail Page, focusing on implementing core user interaction features: MVP download functionality and a review/rating submission system.

### 1. Download Functionality

**Goal:** Implement a download button on `MVPDetailPage.tsx` that simulates checking user download quotas before providing a (mock) download path.

**Implementation Details:**

*   **`src/lib/api.ts` (APIService):**
    *   Added a new method: `downloadMVP(mvpId: string, userId: string): Promise<{ success: boolean; message: string; filePath?: string }>`.
    *   **Simulated Quota Check:**
        *   The method uses a hardcoded mock user profile object (e.g., `{ id: userId, download_quota: 5, daily_download_limit: 2, ... }`) to simulate fetching user data. This mock can be easily changed to test different quota scenarios (e.g., `download_quota: 0`).
        *   It checks if `profile.download_quota <= 0`. If so, it returns `{ success: false, message: "You have reached your download quota..." }`.
        *   A simplified daily limit check placeholder is included but primarily relies on the main `download_quota`.
    *   **Mock File Path:** If the quota check passes, it returns a success response with a mock file path, e.g., `{ success: true, message: "Download initiated!", filePath: \`/downloads/mvp_${mvpId}_v1.zip\` }`.
    *   **Simulated Quota Decrement:** Logs to the console that it *would* update the user's `download_quota` and `last_download_date` in the database.
    *   Includes `try...catch` for general error handling.

*   **`src/pages/MVPDetailPage.tsx`:**
    *   Added state variables `isDownloading` (boolean) and `downloadMessage` (string) to manage the download process UI.
    *   The "Download MVP" button's `onClick` handler was enhanced:
        *   It now calls `APIService.downloadMVP(mvp.id, auth.user.id)`.
        *   `isDownloading` state is set to `true` during the API call and `false` upon completion.
        *   `downloadMessage` is updated based on the API response (success or error message).
        *   If the API call is successful, an `alert()` simulates the file download with the received `filePath`.
    *   **User Feedback:**
        *   The download button is disabled and shows a spinner when `isDownloading` is `true`.
        *   The `downloadMessage` is displayed near the button, styled appropriately for success or error.
    *   **Authentication Check:** The download button is disabled if no user is logged in (`auth.user` is null), and its text changes to "Login to Download". A message prompts non-authenticated users to log in.

*   **`src/types/index.ts`:**
    *   The `User` interface was updated to include optional fields: `download_quota?: number`, `daily_download_limit?: number`, and `last_download_date?: string`. This aligns with the fields used in the `APIService.downloadMVP` mock logic and prepares for future database integration.

### 2. Review and Rating Submission System

**Goal:** Enable authenticated users to submit reviews (rating and comment) for MVPs on the `MVPDetailPage.tsx`, with the review list updating dynamically.

**Implementation Details:**

*   **`src/components/mvp/SubmitReviewForm.tsx` (New Component):**
    *   **Form Structure:** A new component created with a form containing:
        *   A star-based rating input (1-5 stars, using `lucide-react` Star icons).
        *   A `textarea` for the review comment.
        *   A submit button.
    *   **State Management:** Manages local state for `rating`, `comment`, `isSubmitting` (for loading indication), and `submissionMessage` (for success/error feedback).
    *   **Props:** Accepts `mvpId: string`, `userId: string`, and an `onReviewSubmitted: () => void` callback function.
    *   **Submission Logic:**
        *   On form submission, it first validates if a rating has been selected.
        *   Calls `APIService.submitReview` with the review data.
        *   Handles `isSubmitting` state and updates `submissionMessage`.
        *   If successful, it calls the `onReviewSubmitted` prop (to trigger review list refresh in the parent) and clears the form fields.

*   **`src/lib/api.ts` (APIService):**
    *   The `submitReview` method was updated (or created if it was a placeholder) to:
        *   Signature: `submitReview(reviewData: { mvpId: string; userId: string; rating: number; comment: string }): Promise<{ success: boolean; message: string; review?: Review }>`.
    *   **Simulated Database Interaction:**
        *   Logs the received `reviewData` to the console.
        *   Performs a basic conceptual validation (e.g., rating between 1-5).
        *   On success, returns a mock `Review` object (e.g., `{ success: true, message: "Review submitted successfully!", review: { id: 'mock_id', ..., created_at: new Date().toISOString(), ...reviewData } }`).
    *   Includes `try...catch` for error handling.

*   **`src/pages/MVPDetailPage.tsx`:**
    *   **Integration of `SubmitReviewForm`:**
        *   Imported `SubmitReviewForm`.
        *   The form is rendered within the "User Reviews" section, but only if a user is authenticated (`auth.user` is not null) and MVP data is loaded.
        *   Necessary props (`mvp.id`, `auth.user.id`, `handleReviewSubmitted`) are passed to the form.
        *   A message prompts non-authenticated users to log in to submit a review.
    *   **`handleReviewSubmitted` Function:**
        *   This new function is called when `SubmitReviewForm` successfully submits a review.
        *   It calls `fetchMVPReviews` (a new function to fetch reviews for the current MVP) to refresh the displayed review list.
        *   It also temporarily displays a "Review submitted successfully!" message on the page.
    *   **Review Data Management:**
        *   Added state variables: `reviews: Review[]`, `reviewsLoading: boolean`, `reviewsError: string | null`.
        *   A `fetchMVPReviews` function was created using `useCallback` to fetch reviews via `APIService.getMVPReviews(mvpId)` and update these state variables.
        *   `fetchMVPReviews` is called initially when the MVP details are loaded and also by `handleReviewSubmitted`.
        *   These states are passed as props to the `MVPReviews` component.

*   **`src/components/mvp/MVPReviews.tsx`:**
    *   **Refactoring for External Data:**
        *   The component was refactored to no longer fetch its own review data.
        *   It now accepts `reviews: Review[]`, `isLoading: boolean`, and `error: string | null` as props.
        *   The internal `useEffect` for data fetching and related states (`loading`, `error`, local `reviews`) were removed.
        *   It now directly renders the review data passed from `MVPDetailPage.tsx`.

*   **`src/types/index.ts`:**
    *   The existing `Review` interface was reviewed. It already contained the necessary fields (`id`, `mvp_id`, `user_id`, `rating`, `review_text` (for comment), `created_at`, `is_verified_buyer`, and optional `user` details) and was deemed suitable for the data structure used in `APIService.submitReview` and displayed by `MVPReviews.tsx`. No changes were required for this type.

These enhancements significantly improve the interactivity and functionality of the MVP Detail Page.

## Date: 15/06/25 - Build Fixes and Updates

Detailed explanation of changes:

1.  **`src/index.css`:**
    *   **Issue:** The `@import` rule for Google Fonts was placed after `@tailwind` directives, causing a CSS build error.
    *   **Fix:** Moved `@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@300;400;500;600;700;800;900&display=swap');` to the beginning of the file, before any `@tailwind` directives, to comply with CSS import order rules.

2.  **`src/pages/MVPDetailPage.tsx`:**
    *   **Issue:** The component `MVPDetailPage` was exported as a default export (`export default MVPDetailPage;`), but the import statement in `src/App.tsx` expected a named export. This caused a build error: `"MVPDetailPage" is not exported by "src/pages/MVPDetailPage.tsx"`.
    *   **Fix:** Changed the component export from a default export to a named export. The component definition was changed from `const MVPDetailPage: React.FC = () => { ... };` to `export const MVPDetailPage: React.FC = () => { ... };` and the line `export default MVPDetailPage;` was removed.

3.  **Browserslist Update:**
    *   **Issue:** The `caniuse-lite` database, which Browserslist uses to determine browser compatibility for CSS and JavaScript features, was outdated.
    *   **Fix:** Executed the command `npx update-browserslist-db@latest` to update the `caniuse-lite` package to the latest version. This ensures that the project uses up-to-date browser compatibility data.
