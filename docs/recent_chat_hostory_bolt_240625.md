Here's a summary of our chat history up until now, based on the provided docs/recent_chat_history_bolt_190625.md and the recent file changes:

Our conversation has focused on building out the MVP Library Platform, progressing through several key features and addressing various technical challenges.

Key Milestones and Features Implemented:

MVP Upload System: A comprehensive system was built for sellers to upload MVPs, including a production-ready form with file upload (ZIP, TAR.GZ, RAR), image gallery, dynamic features list, tech stack selection, validation, and progress indicators. This also involved integrating with Supabase Storage and database, slug generation, and simulating IPFS queuing.
MVP Detail Pages: Individual showcase pages for MVPs were implemented, featuring dynamic routing, comprehensive details display, interactive image galleries, and download functionality with simulated quota checks.
Review and Rating System: A full review system was added to MVP detail pages, allowing users to submit star ratings and comments, with reviews displayed dynamically.
Seller Management: A "My MVPs" page was created for sellers to manage their uploaded MVPs, including status filtering (Approved, Pending, Rejected) and quick actions (View, Edit, Delete).
Seller Registration: A multi-step seller signup page was developed to onboard new sellers, including account setup, experience details, portfolio information, and terms agreement.
Admin Dashboard (Initial): An initial version of the admin dashboard was implemented, providing role-based access, key platform statistics, and an MVP review queue for approval/rejection.
Beta Account System: A special "beta" account (beta/beta) was set up for testing, granting full buyer, seller, and admin access with pre-approval and unlimited quotas. A prominent "Beta Access" button was added to the authentication page.
Navigation and Routing Fixes: Several issues related to navigation and routing were addressed, including:
Refactoring internal links to use react-router-dom's useNavigate hook instead of window.location.href to prevent 404 errors after login and ensure smooth client-side transitions.
Fixing the admin dashboard routing to prevent 404 errors when directly accessing the /admin route.
Implementing placeholder routes for various future pages to ensure all navigation links are functional.
Build and Stability Improvements: Critical build errors were resolved, such as CSS import order issues and component export mismatches. The caniuse-lite database was updated for browser compatibility.
Stripe Integration (Manual Configuration): The platform has a manually configured Stripe setup for payments and payouts. This includes handling subscriptions, Stripe Connect for seller onboarding, and payout management. It's important to note that this manual setup cannot be migrated to Bolt's managed integration.
GitHub App Integration (In Progress): We've begun implementing a more secure GitHub App integration for automatic MVP updates from repositories. This involves:
Adding github_repo_owner, github_repo_name, last_synced_github_commit_sha, github_webhook_secret, and github_app_installation_id fields to the MVP type.
Creating new Edge Functions (create-github-app-installation, get-github-app-token, github-webhook) to handle GitHub App authentication, token generation, and webhook processing.
Developing a GitHubAppCallbackPage to manage the GitHub App installation flow.
Updating the APIService and MVPUploadService to support GitHub repository linking, unlinking, validation, and automated updates from GitHub commits/releases.
Adding UI elements in MyMVPsPage and a GitHubLinkModal to facilitate linking and syncing MVPs with GitHub repositories.
The current focus is on completing the GitHub App integration, specifically configuring environment variables and thoroughly testing the new functionality.
