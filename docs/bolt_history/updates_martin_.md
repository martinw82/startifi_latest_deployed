Comprehensive Update Log: MVP Library Platform
This log details the significant progress made on the MVP Library Platform, outlining new features, improved functionalities, and critical bug fixes implemented throughout our development sessions.

1. Core Platform & UI/UX Improvements

SPA Navigation Overhaul: Refactored the application's navigation to provide a true Single Page Application (SPA) experience. All internal links now utilize react-router-dom's Link components and useNavigate hook, eliminating full page reloads and ensuring smooth client-side transitions. This addressed initial issues where window.location.href was causing suboptimal user experience.
Placeholder Route Implementation: A robust routing setup has been established, including the definition of numerous placeholder routes in src/App.tsx and the creation of a generic PlaceholderPage.tsx. This ensures all anticipated navigation links are functional and provide clear "under construction" messages.
Build Fixes and Stability: Critical build errors have been resolved, including:
Correcting CSS import order in src/index.css to prevent compilation issues.
Fixing component export mismatches (e.g., MVPDetailPage) to ensure proper module loading.
Updating the caniuse-lite database for improved browser compatibility.
Beta Account System: A dedicated "beta" account (beta/beta) has been implemented for comprehensive testing. This account grants full buyer, seller, and admin access with pre-approval and unlimited quotas, facilitating thorough testing of all platform features. A prominent "Beta Access" button has been added to the authentication page for easy access.
2. MVP Management & User Interaction

MVP Detail Pages (Full Implementation):
Foundation: Comprehensive individual showcase pages (MVPDetailPage.tsx) have been created with dynamic routing, displaying all MVP details (title, description, features, tech stack, seller info).
Image Gallery: An interactive image gallery (MVPImageGallery.tsx) has been integrated to showcase MVP preview images with thumbnails.
Download System (Simulated): A simulated quota-based download functionality has been implemented, allowing authenticated users to "download" MVPs while respecting mock download limits.
Review & Rating System: A complete review and rating system has been added, enabling users to submit star ratings and comments (SubmitReviewForm.tsx) and view existing reviews (MVPReviews.tsx).
Seller Registration & Upload System:
Seller Signup Page: A multi-step application process (SellerSignupPage.tsx) has been developed for new sellers, covering account setup, experience details, and portfolio information.
MVP Upload Page: A comprehensive MVP upload system (UploadMVPPage.tsx) is in place, featuring forms for metadata, file uploads (ZIP, TAR.GZ, RAR), and image gallery management.
Seller Portfolio Management: The "My MVPs" page (MyMVPsPage.tsx) allows sellers to manage their uploaded MVPs, including status filtering (Approved, Pending, Rejected) and quick actions (View, Edit, Delete).
Demo MVP: A production-quality demo MVP ("AI-Powered SaaS Starter Kit") has been added to showcase platform capabilities.
Admin Dashboard (Initial Implementation): An initial version of the admin dashboard (AdminDashboardPage.tsx) has been implemented, providing role-based access, key platform statistics, and an MVP review queue for approval/rejection. Routing issues for direct access to /admin have been resolved.
Retry Processing for MVPs: For MVPs that fail security scanning (scan_failed) or IPFS pinning (ipfs_pin_failed), a "Retry Processing" button has been added to the MyMVPsPage.tsx. This allows sellers to re-queue the processing of their MVP files. The UI now also displays the last_processing_error message for failed MVPs, providing more context.
3. Integrations

Stripe Integration (Manual Configuration): The platform features a manually configured Stripe setup for payment processing, subscription management, and seller payouts via Stripe Connect. This includes handling subscription lifecycle events, seller onboarding, and payout management.
GitHub App Integration (Code Complete): A robust and secure GitHub App integration has been largely implemented to enable automatic MVP updates from private repositories. Key components include:
Database Schema Updates: The github_app_installation_id column has been relocated to the profiles table, and last_processing_error has been added to the mvps table.
Edge Functions: New Edge Functions (create-github-app-installation, get-github-app-token, initiate-github-oauth) handle GitHub App authentication, token generation, and OAuth flow. The existing github-webhook Edge Function has been modified to verify webhook signatures and use installation access tokens for authenticated GitHub API calls.
Frontend UI: The GitHubLinkModal.tsx and GitHubAppCallbackPage.tsx components facilitate the GitHub App installation and repository linking process. The APIService.GitHubService methods now handle authenticated GitHub API interactions. The MyMVPsPage.tsx includes UI elements for linking and syncing MVPs with GitHub repositories.
4. Backend & Database Enhancements

RLS Policy Fixes: Row Level Security (RLS) policies have been refined to prevent infinite recursion issues, particularly when checking admin status. A secure is_admin() SQL function has been introduced to safely bypass RLS for administrative checks.
Database Schema Updates: As mentioned above, the github_app_installation_id column has been relocated to the profiles table, and last_processing_error has been added to the mvps table.
