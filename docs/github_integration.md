currently integrated github but using a public webhook system, so we need more secure app integration as follows 

To support private GitHub repositories for your MVP Library platform, the most robust and secure approach is to integrate with GitHub Apps. This involves creating a GitHub App, updating your database schema to store installation IDs, developing new backend Edge Functions for authentication, and modifying your frontend to facilitate the installation process.

Here is a detailed plan to implement GitHub App integration:

The Plan
1. External Setup: Create and Configure GitHub App
This step needs to be performed by you directly on GitHub.

Create a New GitHub App:
Go to your GitHub profile settings, then "Developer settings" -> "GitHub Apps" -> "New GitHub App".
GitHub App Name: Choose a descriptive name (e.g., "MVP Library Integration").
Homepage URL: https://mvplibrary.dev (or your development URL).
User authorization callback URL: https://mvplibrary.dev/github-app-callback (this will be a new page/route in your frontend).
Webhook URL: https://your-supabase-edge-function-url/github-webhook (your existing webhook URL).
Webhook Secret: Generate a strong, unique secret here. You will need to store this securely in your Supabase environment variables (GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET). This is different from the per-MVP webhook secret.
Permissions:
Repository permissions:
Contents: Read & write (for downloading archives).
Metadata: Read-only (for repository info).
Webhooks: Read & write (for managing webhooks, though you might continue manual setup for now).
Releases: Read-only (for release information).
Organization permissions: None needed initially.
Subscribe to events:
Push
Release
Installation (important for capturing installation events)
Installation repositories (important for capturing repository access changes)
Where can this GitHub App be installed?: "Any account" (if you want sellers from different organizations/users to use it) or "Only on this account" (if only your organization's repos will be linked).
Generate Private Key: After creating the app, generate a private key. Download the .pem file. You will need its content for your Edge Functions. Store this securely in your Supabase environment variables (GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY).
Note App Credentials: Make a note of your GitHub App's App ID and Client ID. These will be used in your frontend and backend. Store Client ID and Client Secret securely in Supabase environment variables (GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID, GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET).
2. Database Schema Update
The mvps table needs a new column to store the GitHub App installation ID associated with each MVP's repository. This ID is crucial for authenticating API calls to private repositories.

Modify mvps table: Add a new column github_app_installation_id of type BIGINT (or TEXT if you prefer, but BIGINT is more appropriate for GitHub's integer IDs).
Reasoning: This column will link a specific MVP to a GitHub App installation on its corresponding repository. When your backend needs to access that repository (e.g., to download a new version), it will use this installation_id to request a temporary access token.

Action Required: This step requires modifying a supabase/migrations file. As per our guidelines, I cannot directly modify restricted files. Please confirm if you would like me to proceed with a plan that includes this database migration, or if you prefer to handle the migration yourself.

3. Backend (Supabase Edge Functions)
You will create two new Edge Functions and modify an existing one.

Create create-github-app-installation Edge Function:

Purpose: This function will handle the callback from GitHub after a user installs your GitHub App. It will exchange the temporary code provided by GitHub for an access_token and then fetch the installation_id. It will then store this installation_id in your database, linked to the relevant MVP.
Input: code (from GitHub callback), installation_id (from GitHub callback), state (which should contain the mvpId).
Output: Success/error message.
Logic:
Verify the state parameter to ensure it matches the mvpId you initiated the installation for.
Use the code and your GitHub App's Client ID and Client Secret to exchange for an access_token with GitHub's OAuth endpoint.
Use the access_token to fetch the installation_id from GitHub (if not already provided in the callback).
Update the mvps table (using the mvpId from state) to store the installation_id in the new github_app_installation_id column.
Reasoning: This function is the bridge between GitHub's installation flow and your database, securely linking an MVP to a GitHub App installation.
Create get-github-app-token Edge Function:

Purpose: This function will generate a short-lived installation access token for a given installation_id. This token is required to make authenticated API calls to GitHub on behalf of the installed app.
Input: installation_id.
Output: installation_access_token.
Logic:
Use your GitHub App's App ID and Private Key (from the .pem file) to generate a JSON Web Token (JWT).
Use this JWT to request an installation_access_token from GitHub's API (/app/installations/{installation_id}/access_tokens).
Return the installation_access_token.
Reasoning: GitHub App tokens are short-lived for security. This function centralizes the secure generation of these tokens, preventing your frontend from needing the private key.
Modify github-webhook Edge Function:

File: supabase/functions/github-webhook/index.ts
Changes:
When processing a webhook, instead of attempting unauthenticated GitHub API calls (e.g., for downloading zipballs), retrieve the github_app_installation_id from the mvps table for the relevant repository.
Call the new get-github-app-token Edge Function to obtain an installation_access_token.
Use this installation_access_token in the Authorization header (e.g., Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN) for all subsequent GitHub API requests within this function (e.g., fetching release details, downloading archive blobs).
Reasoning: This ensures that your webhook can securely access private repositories and download their contents, as it will be authenticated as the installed GitHub App.
4. Frontend (React Application)
You will update your API service, a new page for the callback, and the GitHub linking modal.

Update src/lib/api.ts (GitHubService):

Modify validateGitHubRepository and getLatestRepositoryInfo:
These methods currently make unauthenticated fetch requests. They need to accept an mvpId (or installationId) as a parameter.
Before making any GitHub API calls, they should call your new get-github-app-token Edge Function to get an installation_access_token.
Include this token in the Authorization header of their fetch requests to GitHub.
Add completeGitHubAppInstallation method:
Purpose: This method will be called from your frontend callback page. It will send the code, installation_id, and mvpId to your create-github-app-installation Edge Function.
Input: code, installation_id, mvpId.
Output: Success/error message.
Modify linkGitHubRepository:
This method will no longer directly store github_app_installation_id. Instead, it will initiate the GitHub App installation flow.
It will construct the GitHub App installation URL (e.g., https://github.com/apps/YOUR_APP_SLUG/installations/new?state=YOUR_MVP_ID).
It will redirect the user to this URL.
Reasoning: This centralizes GitHub API interactions and ensures all calls to private repositories are properly authenticated using the GitHub App's installation token.
Create src/pages/GitHubAppCallbackPage.tsx:

Purpose: This new page will serve as the User authorization callback URL configured in your GitHub App.
Logic:
On component mount, extract the code and installation_id (and state which contains mvpId) from the URL query parameters.
Call the new GitHubService.completeGitHubAppInstallation method with these parameters.
Display a loading state or success/error message.
Upon successful completion, redirect the user to MyMVPsPage or the MVP's detail page.
Reasoning: This page handles the final step of the GitHub App installation flow, capturing the necessary IDs and completing the linking process in your database.
Update src/App.tsx:

Add new route: Add a new Route for /github-app-callback pointing to GitHubAppCallbackPage.
Reasoning: To make the new callback page accessible.
Update src/components/mvp/GitHubLinkModal.tsx:

Modify UI for GitHub App Installation:
If the MVP is not yet linked to a GitHub App installation, display a prominent button like "Install GitHub App".
When this button is clicked, use the GitHubService.linkGitHubRepository method to redirect the user to the GitHub App installation URL.
Remove the direct input for github_repo_owner and github_repo_name if the primary linking method becomes the GitHub App installation. These fields might still be useful for display or for manual linking if the app is already installed.
Update handleLink logic: The handleLink function will now primarily trigger the GitHub App installation flow, rather than just storing owner/repo name. The actual linking (storing installation_id) will happen in the GitHubAppCallbackPage.
Reasoning: This provides a clear and guided user experience for linking GitHub repositories via the GitHub App.
5. Environment Variables
Ensure all necessary environment variables are set in your Supabase project and locally for development.

GITHUB_APP_ID
GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY (content of the .pem file)
GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID
GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET
GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET (the secret you set in GitHub App settings)
New Dependencies
Backend (Edge Functions): You might need jsonwebtoken (or similar JWT library) for generating JWTs for GitHub App authentication. npm:jsonwebtoken can be used.
Frontend: No new npm packages are strictly necessary, as existing fetch and react-router-dom capabilities will be leveraged.
This plan outlines a comprehensive approach to integrating GitHub Apps for private repository support. Please let me know if you approve this plan, especially regarding the database schema modification, so we can proceed.

The next crucial step is to ensure all the required environment variables are correctly configured, as this integration relies heavily on them. Additionally, if you haven't already, you'll need to perform the database migration to add the github_app_installation_id column to your mvps table.

The Plan
Configure Environment Variables: You need to set up the following environment variables in your Supabase project and locally for development. These are essential for your GitHub App to function correctly.

GITHUB_APP_ID
GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY (the content of the .pem file you downloaded from GitHub)
GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID
GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET
GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET (the webhook secret you set in your GitHub App settings)
VITE_GITHUB_APP_SLUG (the slug of your GitHub App, usually derived from its name, e.g., mvp-library-integration)
Perform Database Migration: If you haven't already, you must add the github_app_installation_id column to your mvps table. This column is critical for linking your MVPs to GitHub App installations. You'll need to create a new migration file for this. The column should be of type BIGINT and can be nullable initially.

Test GitHub App Integration: Once the environment variables are set and the database is migrated, you should thoroughly test the new GitHub App integration:

Try linking a new MVP to a GitHub repository using the updated modal.
Go through the GitHub App installation flow.
Verify that the github_app_installation_id is correctly stored in your Supabase database for the linked MVP.
Test pushing a new commit or creating a new release in the linked GitHub repository to see if the github-webhook correctly triggers an update for your MVP.
