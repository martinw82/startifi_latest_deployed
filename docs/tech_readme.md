## 3. Development History & Key Milestones

The project has evolved through several key phases, addressing core functionalities and refining the user experience.

### Initial Setup & Core Infrastructure:
- Project initialized with Vite, React, and TypeScript.
- Custom glass morphism design system implemented with Tailwind.
- Basic component architecture established.
- Supabase integration for authentication and database.

### Authentication & Profile Management:
- Implemented user authentication (sign-up, sign-in, sign-out) using Supabase Auth.
- Developed a profile management system with roles (buyer, seller, admin, both).
- **PGRST116 Error Fix**: Addressed an issue where users without existing profiles would cause a PGRST116 error during getCurrentUser() calls. The AuthService.getCurrentUser() method was enhanced to automatically create a default profile for such users upon their first login.

### SPA Navigation Overhaul:
- **Issue**: Initial navigation used window.location.href for internal links, causing full page reloads and a suboptimal SPA experience.
- **Solution**: Refactored `Header.tsx`, `Footer.tsx`, `BuyerDashboardPage.tsx`, and `SellerDashboardPage.tsx` to exclusively use `Link` components and the `useNavigate` hook from `react-router-dom` for internal navigation. This ensures smooth client-side transitions.

### Placeholder Route Implementation:
- Defined numerous placeholder routes in `src/App.tsx` for future features.
- Created a generic `PlaceholderPage.tsx` component to render for these routes, providing a clear "under construction" message.
- Added consistent navigation across the platform to avoid dead links.

### Database Schema Improvements:
- Added extended profile fields for user customization
- Created notification, refund, and dispute tables
- Implemented OAuth token storage for third-party integrations
- Added deployment tracking for Netlify integration

### Auth & Data Fetching Code Review:
- A comprehensive review of `auth.ts`, `useAuth.ts`, `api.ts`, and dashboard data fetching logic was conducted.
- **Strengths**: Resilient authentication core, clear auth state management, centralized API service, typed Supabase interactions.
- **Areas for Improvement**: Usage of mock data in `SellerDashboardPage.tsx` and `APIService.ts`, limited user-facing error feedback, potential state synchronization issues for dynamic user data, need for thorough RLS testing, and a more robust logging strategy.

### MVP Detail Pages:
- **Phase 1 (Foundation)**:
  - Scaffolded `MVPDetailPage.tsx` and added its route (`/mvp/:mvpId`) to `App.tsx`.
  - Implemented data fetching and display for core MVP details (title, description, features, tech stack, seller info).
  - Created and integrated `MVPImageGallery.tsx` for displaying preview images.
  - Added display for "Live Demo" and "GitHub Repository" links.
  - Included a placeholder "Download MVP" button and an initial `MVPReviews.tsx` component.
- **Enhancements (Download & Review System)**:
  - Implemented a simulated download functionality on `MVPDetailPage.tsx` with quota checking via `APIService.downloadMVP`.
  - Developed a review and rating submission system using `SubmitReviewForm.tsx`, allowing authenticated users to submit star ratings and comments.
  - Refactored `MVPReviews.tsx` to accept review data as props, enabling dynamic updates.

### Seller Registration & Upload System:
- Created `SellerSignupPage.tsx`, a multi-step form for users to apply as sellers.
- Includes fields for personal info, experience, specializations, portfolio, and terms agreement.
- Integrates with `AuthService.signUp` to register users with a 'seller' role.
- Implemented comprehensive MVP upload system with file validation, progress tracking, and metadata management.

### Admin Dashboard:
- Implemented `AdminDashboardPage.tsx` with role-based access control (only 'admin' or 'both' roles).
- Features a tabbed interface for Overview, MVP Reviews, User Management (placeholder), and Analytics (placeholder).
- Overview displays key platform statistics and pending MVP reviews.
- **Issue**: Manual browsing to `/admin` sometimes resulted in a 404.
- **Solution**: Ensured proper client-side routing with `useNavigate` for redirects and added a catch-all route in `App.tsx` to prevent 404s for unmatched paths. Enhanced authentication checks and loading states for the admin section.

### Beta Account for Testing:
- Implemented a special 'beta' user (`beta/beta`) with full buyer, seller, and admin access.
- This account bypasses certain checks and uses mock data for testing purposes, preventing database pollution.
- A prominent "Beta Access" button was added to `AuthPage.tsx` for easy login.

### Build Fixes and Updates:
- **Issue**: `@import` rule for Google Fonts in `src/index.css` was placed after `@tailwind` directives, causing a CSS build error.
- **Solution**: Moved the `@import` rule to the very beginning of `src/index.css`, before any `@tailwind` directives, as required by CSS specifications.
- **Issue**: `MVPDetailPage` was exported as a default export but imported as a named export in `src/App.tsx`, leading to a build error.
- **Solution**: Changed `MVPDetailPage` to a named export (`export const MVPDetailPage`).
- **Issue**: Outdated `caniuse-lite` database used by Browserslist.
- **Solution**: Executed `npx update-browserslist-db@latest` to update the package.

### RLS Policy Fixes:
- **Issue**: Infinite recursion detected in RLS policies, particularly when checking admin status from within a policy on the profiles table.
- **Solution**: Created a `SECURITY DEFINER` SQL function `is_admin()` that safely checks the user's role without triggering RLS recursion. All admin-related RLS policies were updated to use this function.
- **Issue**: Users could not insert their own profile after signing up due to a missing RLS policy.
- **Solution**: Added a specific `INSERT` policy for the `profiles` table allowing authenticated users to insert a row where `auth.uid() = id`.
- Added secure token storage for GitHub and Netlify integration.

### Stripe Connect & Payouts Integration:
- **Implementation of `src/pages/ConnectStripePage.tsx`**: Complete Stripe Connect onboarding flow for sellers.
- **Implementation of `src/pages/PayoutsPage.tsx`**: Comprehensive payout management interface for sellers.
- **Enhanced `supabase/functions/stripe-webhook/index.ts`**: Comprehensive webhook handling system for subscription lifecycle, payment processing, Stripe Connect events, and payout tracking.
- **New Edge Function `supabase/functions/create-stripe-connect-account/index.ts`**: Stripe Connect account creation and onboarding.
- **Enhanced API Methods in `src/lib/api.ts`**: Comprehensive payout and Stripe Connect management.
- **Updated `src/pages/AdminDashboardPage.tsx`**: Enhanced administrative capabilities with "Pending Payouts" section.

### GitHub App Integration (In Progress):
- **Database Schema Update**: Added GitHub-related fields to the database schema, including repository details, commit SHAs, and webhook secrets. The `github_app_installation_id` is stored in the `profiles` table to associate installations with users.
