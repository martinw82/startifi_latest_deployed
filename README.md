## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema Overview

The platform uses a comprehensive PostgreSQL schema with the following key tables:

- **subscriptions**: User subscription plans and billing
- **mvps**: MVP listings with metadata and files
- **downloads**: Download tracking for quota management
- **reviews**: User reviews and ratings
- **notifications**: System notifications
- **payouts**: Seller commission tracking
- **refund_requests**: Subscription refund handling
- **disputes**: Buyer-seller dispute resolution
- **audit_logs**: System audit trail

All tables have Row Level Security (RLS) enabled with comprehensive policies for data protection.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Supabase account and project
- Git

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone and Install**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd mvp-library-platform
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**
   Create a `.env` file with your Supabase credentials:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

3. **Database Setup**
   - Run the migration files in `supabase/migrations/` in order
   - This will create all tables, RLS policies, and functions

4. **Start Development**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Important Notes for Developers

#### Authentication Fix (PGRST116 Error)
- **Issue**: Existing users from before profile creation might not have profile records
- **Solution**: The `getCurrentUser()` method now automatically creates missing profiles
- **Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED - Implemented automatic profile creation for existing users

#### RLS Policies
- All database operations go through Row Level Security
- Admin functions use `SECURITY DEFINER` to prevent recursion
- Test with different user roles to ensure proper access control

#### Component Architecture
- Use `GlassCard` for consistent glass morphism design
- Use `GlossyButton` for all interactive elements
- Follow the established color scheme and spacing system

### Recent Refinements by ~jules~  (please refer to jules_readme.md file for full and specific and uptodate information about upgrades and bug fixes done by jules)
The following is a summary of key activities performed by ~jules~:
*   **SPA Navigation Overhaul**: Corrected a core bug by refactoring navigation across key components (`Header.tsx`, `Footer.tsx`, `BuyerDashboardPage.tsx`, `SellerDashboardPage.tsx`) from direct `window.location.href` calls to `Link` components from `react-router-dom`. This ensures a true single-page application experience, preventing full page reloads.
*   **Placeholder Route Implementation**: Established a robust routing setup by defining numerous placeholder routes in `src/App.tsx` and creating a generic `PlaceholderPage.tsx` to handle these, ensuring all anticipated navigation links are functional.
*   **Link Destination Verification**: Confirmed with user input that all previously ambiguous links (e.g., `/support`, `/contact`) should indeed be treated as internal SPA routes, validating the current placeholder setup.
*   **Auth & Data Fetching Code Review**: Conducted a comprehensive review of authentication and data fetching logic (`auth.ts`, `useAuth.ts`, `api.ts`, dashboard pages). Provided a detailed report with findings on overall health, strengths (resilient auth core, centralized API), and areas for improvement (mock data usage, user error handling, RLS testing, placeholder logic in API).
*   **MVP Detail Pages (Complete Implementation)**:
    *   Scaffolded `MVPDetailPage.tsx` with dynamic routing and comprehensive MVP showcase
    *   Created interactive `MVPImageGallery.tsx` with main image and thumbnails
    *   Implemented simulated download functionality with quota checking via `APIService.downloadMVP`
    *   Built review and rating submission system (`SubmitReviewForm.tsx`, `APIService.submitReview`)
    *   Enhanced `MVPReviews.tsx` to accept review data as props for dynamic updates
*   **Seller Registration & Upload System**:
    *   Created `SellerSignupPage.tsx` with multi-step form for seller application
    *   Implemented comprehensive MVP upload system (`UploadMVPPage.tsx`, `MVPUploadService`)
    *   Built `MyMVPsPage.tsx` for seller portfolio management with status filtering
    *   Added demo MVP "AI-Powered SaaS Starter Kit" for platform showcase
*   **Admin Dashboard Implementation**:
    *   Created `AdminDashboardPage.tsx` with role-based access control
    *   Implemented tabbed interface with Overview, MVP Reviews, User Management, and Analytics
    *   Added MVP approval queue with approve/reject functionality
    *   Fixed routing issues for `/admin` route to prevent 404 errors
*   **Beta Account & System Enhancements**:
    *   Implemented special `beta/beta` user with full buyer/seller/admin access
    *   Added prominent "Beta Access" button to `AuthPage.tsx`
    *   Fixed login navigation using `useNavigate` to prevent 404 issues
    *   Resolved build errors (CSS import order, component exports, Browserslist update)
*   15/06/25 - Fixed build errors related to CSS import order and component export. Updated Browserslist.
