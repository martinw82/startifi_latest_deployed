## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Supabase account and project
- Git

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone and Install**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd mvp-library-platform
npm install
```

2. **Environment Setup**
Create a `.env` file with your Supabase credentials and other environment variables:
```env
# Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# GitHub App Configuration
VITE_GITHUB_APP_SLUG=your-github-app-slug

# Stripe (if manually configuring)
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_stripe_public_key
```

3. **Database Setup**
```bash
# All migrations have been applied to your Supabase project
# No additional steps required
```

4. **Start Development**
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Important Notes for Developers

#### Authentication Fix (PGRST116 Error)
- **Issue**: Existing users from before profile creation might not have profile records
- **Solution**: The `getCurrentUser()` method now automatically creates missing profiles
- **Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED - Automatic profile creation implemented

#### RLS Policies
- All database operations are protected by Row Level Security (RLS)
- Admin functions use `SECURITY DEFINER` to prevent recursion
- The secure `is_admin()` function handles admin access checks

#### GitHub/Netlify Integration
- Initial integration is complete and functional
- Supabase Edge Functions faced size/memory constraints
- Final implementation will use external worker system for processing large files
- OAuth-based authentication for both GitHub and Netlify

#### Component Architecture
- Use `GlassCard` for consistent glass morphism design
- Use `GlossyButton` for all interactive elements
- Follow the established color scheme and spacing system

### Recent Refinements by ~jules~  (please refer to jules_readme.md file for full and specific and uptodate information about upgrades and bug fixes done by jules)
The following is a summary of key activities performed by ~jules~:
*   **SPA Navigation Overhaul**: Corrected a core bug by refactoring navigation across key components (`Header.tsx`, `Footer.tsx`, `BuyerDashboardPage.tsx`, `SellerDashboardPage.tsx`) from direct `window.location.href` calls to `Link` components from `react-router-dom`. This ensures a true single-page application experience, preventing full page reloads.
*   **Placeholder Route Implementation**: Established a robust routing setup by defining numerous placeholder routes in `src/App.tsx` and creating a generic `PlaceholderPage.tsx` to handle these, ensuring all anticipated navigation links are functional.
*   **Link Destination Verification**: Confirmed with user input that all previously ambiguous links (e.g., `/support`, `/contact`) should indeed be treated as internal SPA routes, validating the current placeholder setup.
*   **Auth & Data Fetching Code Review**: Conducted a comprehensive review of authentication and data fetching logic (`auth.ts`, `useAuth.ts`, `api.ts`, dashboard pages). Provided a detailed report with findings on overall health, strengths (resilient auth core, centralized API), and areas for improvement (mock data usage, user error handling, RLS testing, placeholder logic in API).
*   **MVP Detail Pages (Complete Implementation)**:
    *   Scaffolded `MVPDetailPage.tsx` with dynamic routing and comprehensive MVP showcase
    *   Created interactive `MVPImageGallery.tsx` with main image and thumbnails

    *   Enhanced review system with verified buyer badges
    *   Added notifications for sellers when their MVPs are downloaded or reviewed

    *   Implemented special `beta/beta` user with full buyer/seller/admin access
    *   Added easy "Beta Access" button to authentication page
    *   Fixed login navigation using `useNavigate` to prevent 404 issues
    *   Resolved build errors (CSS import order, component exports, Browserslist update)
*   **Comprehensive Notification System**:
    *   Real-time notifications for platform activities
    *   Unread notification count in header
    *   Mark-as-read functionality
    *   Notification filtering
*   **Dispute Resolution System**:
    *   Complete buyer-seller dispute workflow
    *   Detailed dispute tracking and history
    *   Resolution status updates
    *   Admin review interface
*   **Refund Request System**:
    *   Subscription refund request workflow
